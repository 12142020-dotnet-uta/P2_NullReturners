# Sports Management Application

## Project Description
We will be creating an application to act as a central hub for coaches, parents, and players of a youth sports team. 
Upon successful login, users will be able to view scheduled meetings and practices, communicate with other users, organize carpooling, 
view team announcements, view the playbook, view/add statistics, and request new gear.
