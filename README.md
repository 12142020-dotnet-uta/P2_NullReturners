## Getting Started
git clone https://github.com/12142020-dotnet-uta/P2_NullReturners.git

## Usage
Coaches are given admin access and can create other users. Once other users are created, they can login and look at the team calendar, message other users, view the game schedule, view the playbook, and look at the team statistics. If the user is a parent, they can request new equipment for their child. Coaches are also able to approve equipment requests, edit the calendar, edit the game schedule, and edit the playbook.
